<p>Nano is a digital currency launched in 2015 (originally as RaiBlocks) and designed for fast, efficient everyday transactions. It features zero transaction fees and is environmentally friendly, as it requires no mining or energy-intensive validation. Nano achieves instant payment finality through its innovative block-lattice architecture, where each account has its own blockchain. This unique design allows asynchronous updates and direct peer-to-peer transfers, enabling high throughput and scalability. Ideal for micro-payments, international remittances, and general digital cash usage, Nano was created by Colin LeMahieu, who now leads The Nano Foundation.</p>
<h2>6. <a href="https://octa.space/">OctaSpace</a> (OCTA)</h2>
<p><strong>Market Cap:</strong> $18.73M</p>
<p>OctaSpace is a decentralized computing marketplace that launched its mainnet in 2022. Built on its own Layer 1, EVM-compatible Proof-of-Work blockchain, it enables users to rent out hardware resources in exchange for compensation, forming a flexible, peer-to-peer cloud computing ecosystem. OctaSpace offers decentralized services including VPNs, distributed computing, GPU rendering for tasks like 3D animation, and data analysis. Users operating hardware nodes can set their own pricing, encouraging a competitive market for computing power. Key contributors to the project include Chief Product Officer Tarik Delic and Chief Technology Officer Artem Teslenko.</p>
<h2>7. <a href="https://www.fact0rn.io/">FACT0RN</a> (FACT)</h2>
<p><strong>Market Cap:</strong> $2.95M</p>
<p>FACT0RN is an open-source Layer 1 blockchain. Its Proof-of-Work mechanism uses integer factorization instead of traditional hashing. Miners solve mathematical problems to secure the network. This also helps with cryptographic research by factoring large numbers. It does not have smart contracts or dApps. Its sole focus is on its unique PoW. Juan Luis Vargas Molina, a Dominican mathematician and cybersecurity pioneer, designed the FACT0RN blockchain. The Coinbase Crypto Community Fund gave FACT0RN a grant, making it a grant winner. This shows its recognition within the crypto community for its innovative approach to Proof-of-Work. It had a fair launch, relying on community and research support.</p>
<h2>8. <a href="https://pkt.cash/">Packet</a> (PKT)</h2>
<p><strong>Market Cap:</strong> $1.84M</p>
<p>Packet Cash is a cryptocurrency project focused on building a global, censorship-resistant internet infrastructure. It operates as a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), where users can earn PKT by providing internet bandwidth through a unique bandwidth proof-of-work mining system. PKT is the world’s first bandwidth-hard blockchain protocol, designed to directly incentivize network growth and performance. The network also enables global media discovery and encrypted mesh networking, leveraging technologies like cjdns, created by Caleb James DeLisle, the project's lead developer. The PKT network is community-powered, with partners including Akash for decentralized cloud services.</p>
<h2>9. <a href="https://www.crust.network/">Crust Network</a> (CRU)</h2>

Crust offers composable cloud storage for developers and end-users, enabling true data ownership and censorship resistance. Co-founded by Stephen Shang, Ludwig Trappe, and Bova Chen, Crust has been mentioned in Ethereum documentation as a decentralized storage solution and has collaborated with entities such as the Algorand Foundation and Arbitrum. Its investors include Bitcoin.com and DWF Labs. Crust Network is also used by Uniswap to help decentralize its frontend interface.</p>
<h2>10. <a href="https://xelis.org/">XELIS</a> (XEL)</h2>
<p><strong>Market Cap:</strong> $5.73M</p>
<p>XELIS is the first privacy-focused Layer 1 protocol powered by a BlockDAG architecture. It is built to prioritize complete financial confidentiality through features like homomorphic encryption, which keeps balances and amounts hidden, as well as ring signatures and stealth addresses that protect user identity and transaction details. XELIS enables the creation of confidential tokens that inherit the same privacy guarantees as its native asset. With support for high-performance smart contracts and a scalable design, XELIS delivers strong privacy, efficiency, and decentralization from the ground up.</p>
<h3>Honorable Mention: <a href="https://koinos.io/">Koinos</a> (KOIN)</h3>
<p><strong>Market Cap:</strong> $3.15M</p>
<p>Koinos is a modular, feeless Layer 1 blockchain built around a unique Proof-of-Burn consensus mechanism, designed to overcome the centralization issues inherent in Proof-of-Stake systems. By requiring users to burn tokens instead of staking them, Koinos avoids concentrating power among wealthy participants and fosters a more decentralized and accessible network. The project was created by the original developers of Steemit, who were motivated to build a more resilient blockchain after witnessing its takeover by exchanges like Binance, Huobi, and Poloniex - who used customer funds to help Justin Sun gain control of the Steemit network. While Koinos introduced significant innovations in governance and smart contract flexibility, its future is now uncertain as key developers have shifted focus to yet another crypto project, leaving the long-term trajectory of Koinos in question.</p>
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>The cryptocurrency space continues to evolve quickly. As you consider these projects, always perform your own research (DYOR). You should understand the technology, the team's vision, and the project's long-term goals. The market changes fast, and what looks promising today requires careful study for tomorrow.</p>
